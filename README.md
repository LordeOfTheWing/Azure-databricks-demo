# Azure-databricks-demo
This repo will contain basic databricks operations to get you started with big data transformations with common different file formats(CSVs, JSON etc).

These file formats will also have different structures e.g CSV (Single CSV file and Split CSV files), JSON(Single Line, Single Line Nested, Multi Line and Split Multi Line) files.
